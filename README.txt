GoogleStudentsLib
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is required for Linka (1) to work properly. Compile it as
a DLL and include it in your VS2010 project as a reference.

This library is designed to work with the Google App Provisioning API
(2) which is being depreciated in April 2015.

This code was written under .NET 1.1 (VS2003) and recently upgraded to
.NET 4.0 (VS2010) so it's kind of but not too hairy.

This code is presented as-is with no license or warranty since it will
not be good for anything within three months of its posting.
